        <p id="name">Oceans:
            The ocean is a vast, continuous body of saltwater covering ~71% of Earth, essential for life, climate regulation, and the water cycle, divided into five major basins (Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern, Arctic).<br> It holds most of Earth's water, produces over half our oxygen, absorbs heat and CO2, and hosts immense biodiversity, from deep trenches to coral reefs, though much remains unexplored and faces threats like pollution. <br>
